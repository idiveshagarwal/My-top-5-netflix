# Getting Started with Create React App

This repository was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Available Scripts

To get started, navigate to the project directory and run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

This script runs the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Use this script to launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, refer to the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section in the Create React App documentation.

### `npm run build`

Running this script builds the application for production. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The compiled code is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed! Check out the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section in the Create React App documentation for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you are unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. Ejecting removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. However, it's not mandatory to use `eject`. Create React App provides a curated feature set that is suitable for most deployments, and you can customize it whenever you're ready.
